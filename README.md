# Jest Mocking Demo

This repository demonstrates how to do mocking in Jest. I wrote this for a training session I did for work. It is assumed that you already have a basic understanding of how to write tests in Jest (specifically, the `it/test()` method and the `expect()` API).

To run the tests in this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rjwut/jest-mock-demo.git
npm install
npm test
```

All tests should pass with 100% coverage.

There are five test suites numbered 1-5. The comments in each file explain how the mocking in the test suite works. It is recommended that you go though the suites in order.
